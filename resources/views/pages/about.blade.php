I’m not an avid reader, but I love to buy books anyway,
 thinking I’ll make time for it. So when I do start going through one,
  I desperately hope it doesn’t disappoint me (oh yes, there are those “bestsellers” out there, too)!

I came across a title in 2019, and spent the winters hooked to it, spending hours sitting out in the sun.
 Any book that brings you such joy is invaluable. It’s the magic in those pages that move you, 
 bring a smile to your face, and heal you. When I come across such sentences, I make sure to highlight them.
  Why? Because I want to hold on to that message. I truly believe it’ll make my day, and drive me to do better. 
<br>
However, I soon realized that a person struggling to keep up with reading can never 
find the time to pick a book already finished, to skim through. The highlighted lines, 
the excitement, all dead. Period. 
<br>    

I wanted to change this. For myself, and so many others out there.
<br>    <br>


The idea for Imprint is 2 years old now. Does that make me sound lazy?

            We endeavour to style our frames to embolden the design they house. During the ideation stage, we work with sketches along with the border styling, to perfect the aesthetic. Following that, we get to work towards crafting an evenly trimmed frame. The artistic finish of our product symbolizes the years of experience our skilled artisans bring into making the designs an elegant reality. 

The end result is a sharp and neat Imprint to be displayed anywhere you want.  </p>
